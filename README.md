# Pomodoro App

Warning: **üöß In Construction**

The Pomodoro App is an App that helps you perform tasks for a while, following the Pomodoro technique.

Basically this technique uses a stopwatch and tells you to focus for 25 minutes, then rest for 5 minutes. After repeating this cycle 4 times, the break time can be 15 minutes.

The app, therefore, has a stopwatch function following good design practices. The user can choose between timing 25, 15 or 5 minutes.

In addition, the app is customizable: you can also configure some things like colors, for example.


## ‚òÉÔ∏è Technologies

This application runs on iOS operating systems and it was made with:

- Swift Programming Language
- UIKit Framework
- View Code

## ü™¥ Instalation

While the app is not available on the store yet, you can run it on your local machine via a simulator.

For this operation, the MacOS operating system and the XCode IDE, used in the construction of iOS applications, are required.

Clone this project or download as ZIP. Open the file with the `.xcodeproj` extension in XCode and build the application. It will run in the simulator of your choice, or if you prefer, on your physical device.
